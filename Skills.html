                    <h2>Photography</h2>
                    <p>Photography is my passion, and I enjoy capturing the beauty of the world through my lens.</p>
                    <p>I've experimented with various photography techniques, including portrait, landscape, and street photography.</p> 
                    <p> I'm skilled in using DSLR cameras and editing software like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop to enhance my images.</p>
                    <p>I'm always eager to learn new techniques and explore different photography genres.</p>
                    <p>I believe that photography is a powerful tool for storytelling and self-expression.</p>

                    <h2>Art</h2>
                    <p>Art is another creative outlet for me, allowing me to express my imagination and emotions.</p>
                    <p>I love to call myself "KID" in my paintings, mostly because it makes me anonymous and</p>
                    <p>challenges the viewer to judge the paintings, instead of me.</p> 
                    <p>I've experimented with various art forms, including painting, drawing, and digital art.</p> 
                    <p>I'm skilled in using traditional art materials like acrylics and watercolors,</p>
                    <p>as well as digital tools like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
                    <p>I'm inspired by the beauty of nature and human creativity.</p> 
                    <p>I believe that art has the power to evoke emotions and inspire others.</p>
